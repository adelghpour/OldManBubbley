About
Every morning, an elderly man with Alzheimer’s wakes up and forgets his past. Step into his world, seeking out hidden objects and tackling clever puzzles that reignite his memories. Piece by piece, you’ll uncover a lifetime of love and loss, stitched back together through touching mini-games and quiet discoveries—before his memories fade again.
